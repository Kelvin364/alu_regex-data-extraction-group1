# Regex Data Extraction Application - Group N

## Overview

This project was developed as part of the **Regex Onboarding Hackathon** at ALU. Our team has built a Python-based web application that extracts specific data types from large strings using **Regular Expressions (Regex)**. The data is collected from multiple web sources, and the application accurately identifies and extracts information such as emails, URLs, phone numbers, credit card numbers, and HTML tags.

## Features

The application extracts the following data types using custom-built regular expressions:

1. **Email Addresses**
2. **URLs**
3. **Phone Numbers**
4. **Credit Card Numbers**
5. **HTML Tags**

## Code Implementation

### Python Functions

We implemented the extraction functions using Python's `re` 
Comprehensive Regex Patterns: Includes a collection of regex patterns for common data extraction tasks.
Language Support: Examples in multiple languages (Python, JavaScript, etc.).
Usage Examples: Detailed scripts and examples for various use cases.
Flexible and Extensible: The regex patterns can be adapted for different use cases as needed.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before using the scripts in this repository, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.x (if you intend to run Python scripts)
Git (for cloning this repository)
A text editor or an IDE like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, etc.
Installation
Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Kelvin364/alu_regex-data-extraction-group1.git
Navigate to the Project Directory

bash
Copy code
cd alu_regex-data-extraction-group1
(Optional) Create a Virtual Environment

If you plan to use Python for regex tasks, it's recommended to create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
.\env\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages (if any). For example:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: Add a requirements.txt file if your project uses specific Python packages.

Usage
Running the Examples

The repository includes example scripts for different regex tasks. To run a script, use:

bash
Copy code
python <script_name>.py
