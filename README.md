# Regex Data Extraction Application - Group 1

## Overview

This project was developed as part of the **Regex Onboarding Hackathon** at ALU. Our team has built a Python-based web application that extracts specific data types from large strings using **Regular Expressions (Regex)**. The data is collected from multiple web sources, and the application accurately identifies and extracts information such as emails, URLs, phone numbers, credit card numbers, and HTML tags.

## Features

The application extracts the following data types using custom-built regular expressions:

1. **Email Addresses**
2. **URLs**
3. **Phone Numbers**
4. **Credit Card Numbers**
5. **HTML Tags**

## Code Implementation

### Python Functions

We implemented the extraction functions using Python's `re` 

- **Comprehensive Regex Patterns:** Includes a collection of regex patterns for common data extraction tasks.
- **Language Support:** Examples in multiple languages (Python, JavaScript, etc.).
- **Usage Examples:** Detailed scripts and examples for various use cases.
- **Flexible and Extensible:** The regex patterns can be adapted for different use cases as needed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using the scripts in this repository, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.x** (if you intend to run Python scripts)
- **Git** (for cloning this repository)
- A text editor or an IDE like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, etc.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kelvin364/alu_regex-data-extraction-group1.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd alu_regex-data-extraction-group1
   ```

3. **(Optional) Create a Virtual Environment**

   If you plan to use Python for regex tasks, it's recommended to create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
   .\env\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Python packages (if any). For example:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Note: Add a `requirements.txt` file if your project uses specific Python packages.*

## Usage

1. **Running the Examples**

   The repository includes example scripts for different regex tasks. To run a script, use:

   ```bash
   python <main>.py
   ```
